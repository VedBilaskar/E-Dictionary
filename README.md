# E-Dictionary
Basic features of a dictionary implemented using a Ternary Search Tree .The TST is initialized using a dataset named dsa.txt which contains a list of word meaning pairs.
I have used file handling to read data from the input file and insert into the TST.
Functions to get the meaning of an existing word, printing all the words in a sorted order and suggesting words based on a prefix(auto complete) are implemented.
